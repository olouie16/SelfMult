# SelfMult

An Audio Plugin for a special kind of Distortion made in JUCE

Born from an idea I had a while ago. 
This plugin doesn't calculates the distortion the usual way, but more like the opposite of overdrive.
For this to work it needed some compensations espacially in terms of volume.
  


### Parameter-Explanations

 - d
	 - adds a kind of fuzz, also softens attacks
 - exp
	 - distorts the sound, can harshen attack at high values
 - vol
	 - volume: the higher, the louder

  
  
  

### To Do:
- mix-Knob
- find a better way to soften attacks from high exp values
- maybe modulate d or exp with LFO?
- better parameter names
- explanations inside the plugin
	- maybe tooltips?
- Mode B
	- another Mode very similar to the already existing
- prettier User Interface
